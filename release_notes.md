## Release notes
| Feature | Description | Release date | Release |
|---------|-------------|--------------|---------|
| Compute Pool | Previously, a Snowpark Container Services Compute Pool may be incorrectly identified as `IDLE` and be suspended despite having `ACTIVE` services or jobs. Now, the show compute pools command output is corrected to display the `ACTIVE` state if there are any active services or jobs. Additionally, the Compute Poolâ€™s auto-suspend timer will only start when there are no active services or jobs. | Mar 7, 2024| 8.9.2|
